# WordPress Plugin Framework

The WordPress Plugin Framework (WPPF) is a pragmatic, code-first toolkit for building WordPress plugins with a consistent structure. It provides a base plugin class, an admin module system, a small CLI for scaffolding, and a growing library of reusable modules.

## What this documentation covers

- A guided tutorial that walks through building a plugin with the CLI.
- Practical notes on framework tools like admin notices, templates, and the Action Scheduler.
